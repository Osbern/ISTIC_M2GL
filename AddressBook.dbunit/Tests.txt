SAMPLE TESTS
Pass:
1. All text fields should be disabled at application startup.
2. All text fields should be enabled after clicking the new button.
3. The button for delete should be enabled when there's a selected item in the list.

Fail:
The application has these bugs, so currently they don't pass. When they are fixed, they will pass.
1. The Save button should not be enabled right after clicking the New button (since there's no data in the fields).
2. The button for Delete should not be enabled where there isn't a selected item in the list.
